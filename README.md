#  CP3402 Practical 1
## Pet Sitting Website
This project is Practical 1 for the CP3402 Content Management System. The task was to create a simple website for a startup business and publish it online. In this project, Iâ€™ve built a pet sitting startup website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Project Overview
The website contains three pages:

- Home (index.html): A welcoming page introducing the pet sitting  services.
- Services (services.html): A page outlining the services provided by the startup, including dog sitting, cat sitting, pet walking, etc.
- Contact (contact.html): A form to allow potential customers to contact the business for more information or to book services.
